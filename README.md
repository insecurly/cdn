## JS based locally run webpage which specializes in bypassing securly's monitoring methods. Insecurly aims to provide a safe and virtually unblockable place to play games, watch youtube, and more. (with no chance of being caught if used correctly)

# Usage:

## Method 1 (website):
- Go to https://insecurly.github.io/cdn and follow the instructions there

## Method 2 (if the website is blocked):
- [![Download index.html](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-index.html-brightgreen)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/insecurly/cdn/main/index.html) to your chromebook
- Save it to your downloads folder
- Open it

# The script will only work if..
- you are whitelisted (go ahead, try to crack it)
- you open it locally, specifically from your chromebook in the "Downloads" folder. This is necessary to read certain information about your device needed for the script

# How do I get whitelisted?
- There are two types of whitelists; permanent and temporary. Both can and will be revoked upon misuse of the script.
- To recieve a *permanant* whitelist, ask the owner of the script to enter a whitelist key. You will have unlimited access to the script on that device.
- To recieve a *temporary* whitelist, click on the temporary option, and proceed with the verification steps. Once completed, you will have 24 hours of access to the script on that device.

# Common Concerns
- Non-invasive! Your personal information is 100% safe. The script only interacts with publicly available info.
