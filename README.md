## JS based locally run webpage which specializes in bypassing securly's monitoring methods. Insecurly aims to provide a safe and virtually unblockable place to play games, watch youtube, and more. (with no chance of being caught if used correctly)

## Usage:
- [![Download index.html](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-index.html-brightgreen)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/insecurly/cdn/main/index.html) to your chromebook
- Save it to your downloads folder
- Open it

## The script will only work if..
- you are whitelisted (go ahead, try to crack it)
- you open it locally, specifically from your chromebook in the "Downloads" folder. This is necessary to read certain information about your device needed for the script

## Common Concerns
- Non-invasive! Your personal information is 100% safe. The script only interacts with publicly available info.
