### Overview
Insecurly is a locally run JavaScript-based webpage designed to bypass monitoring methods like Securly. It provides a safe and virtually unblockable environment for activities such as playing games and watching YouTube.

### Features
- Toggle Tab Hiding (anyone watching your screen on securly will see a blank page, so you can watch youtube/play games on the webpage unbothered)
- Youtube integration (load any youtube video with the link to it, which is inconvinient but due to security reasons it's not possible to load the actual homepage)
- Snake Game (self explanatory, it took me 5 hours to get it to work. also you can still play snake with tab hiding on ur welcome)
